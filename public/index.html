            A typical gardener might only get 40 growing seasons. Whether you’re
            growing vegetables or cut flowers, fruits or shrubs, you’ll want to
            remember everything that happens in your garden. Keep a journal
            using
            <span class="inline-logo"><span>this</span>garden</span>
            and take the guesswork out of it.

          <h1>Everything in one place</h1>
          <p>
            Add every plant in your garden, with no limits. Whether they're old
            favourites or just this year's experiment, keep track of everything
            you sow, plant, pick and harvest. Build your knowledge and look back
            at everything you accomplish.

            Every time you spot something interesting, take a note. Seeing slug
            damage? You'll want to remember when they first appeared. Dahlia
            bulbs spent half of April under water? You'll know why they didn't
            look so great come July.

            Look back at last year to see what worked well and what needs
            adjustment. Did your broad bean seeds sit dormant from February to
            April before producing a crop over the next 6 weeks? Plant them
            later this year and use that precious space for something more
            likely to show a return.
